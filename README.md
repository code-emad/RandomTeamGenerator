# Random Team Generator

## Purpose
I play football once a week and making teams has always been a challenge. The goal of this frontend project was to create a user interface that allowed users to input 14 players which would then be split into Team 1 and Team 2.

A link to the project can be found [here](https://emads-random-team-generator.netlify.app/).

## Setup
If you wish to make a local clone of this project, within your terminal you will need to run `git clone https://github.com/code-emad/RandomTeamGenerator.git`.

Once the files have been cloned, you will need to change directory into the project directory and run `npm install` which will install the dependencies listed within the package.json file.

`npm start` will allow you to run the app in development mode. Within your browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

## Minimum Versions
Node v19.1.0
